# Airbnb Clone - Web Static Design

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the static design of our Airbnb clone. This project is part of our web development course, focusing on creating a static web page that mimics Airbnb's style and layout.

## Project Overview

This project aims to replicate a simplified version of the Airbnb homepage using only HTML and CSS. The design must be compliant with the W3C standards, and all CSS should follow the best practices outlined below.

## Directory Structure

- `/styles`: This folder contains all the CSS files needed for styling the website.
- `/images`: This folder includes all the images used across the website.

## Development Guidelines

### HTML

- Ensure all HTML is W3C compliant. Use the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check your code.
- Do not use `<img>`, `<embed>`, and `<iframe>` tags.
- Structure your HTML to reflect the layout of a typical Airbnb homepage.

### CSS

- All CSS files must be located in the `styles` folder.
- Do not use `!important` or IDs (`#`) in CSS files.
- Base your margins and paddings on the screenshots provided, approximating as necessary.
- Ensure your styles are neat and do not interfere with the readability of HTML elements.

### Testing

- Use Google Chrome (version 56 or higher) to test your pages.
- Ensure your pages render correctly in this browser without needing cross-browser compatibility.
